You have a good heart, Dexter. I have a dark side, too. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Only you could make those words cute. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.</p>

    teaser: <p>I'm Santa Claus! Say it in Russian! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</p>
    body: '<p>Eeeee!  Now say "nuclear wessels"! What are their names? Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</p><h3>The Cryonic Woman</h3><p>Also Zoidberg. I didn''t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Yeah, and if you were the pope they''d be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Well, let''s just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p><p>I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of ''will''? WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p><p>Dear God, they''ll be killed on our doorstep! And there''s no trash pickup until January 3rd. It''s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Hey! I''m a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Bender, quit destroying the universe!</p><p>I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Bender?! You stole the atom. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! I love you, buddy! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</p><p>Check it out, y''all. Everyone who was invited is here. You can see how I lived before I met you. No, of course not. It was&hellip; uh&hellip; porno. Yeah, that''s it. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. And from now on you''re all named Bender Jr. There, now he''s trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! You can see how I lived before I met you. Kids have names?</p><h3>A Bicyclops Built For Two</h3><p>Oh sure! Blame the wizards! And why did ''I'' have to take a cab? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! You lived before you met me?! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</p><p>Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I just told you! You''ve killed me! Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I''m still single? It''s ''cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! You know, I was God once. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Hey, what kinda party is this? There''s no booze and only one hooker. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.</p><p>I just told you! You''ve killed me! Dear God, they''ll be killed on our doorstep! And there''s no trash pickup until January 3rd. If rubbin'' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don''t wanna be right. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Negative, bossy meat creature! You won''t have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you''ll be doing. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Shut up and get to the point!</p><p>What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Do a flip! No! The cat shelter''s on to me. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Also Zoidberg. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn''t you just get me the death penalty?</p><p>Oh dear! She''s stuck in an infinite loop, and he''s an idiot! Well, that''s love for you. We''re also Santa Claus! And remember, don''t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don''t not do it!</p><p>No, she''ll probably make me do it. Hey, whatcha watching? Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</p><h3>Lesser of Two Evils</h3><p>Well, let''s just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. And remember, don''t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don''t not do it! Do a flip! Hey, whatcha watching? Soothe us with sweet lies. Hi, I''m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Ah, the ''Breakfast Club'' soundtrack!  I can''t wait til I''m old enough to feel ways about stuff! It''s toe-tappingly tragic!</p><p>You guys aren''t Santa! You''re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? They''re like sex, except I''m having them! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</p><p>Say it in Russian! Hey, whatcha watching? When the lights go out, it''s nobody''s business what goes on between two consenting adults.</p><p>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Aww, it''s true. I''ve been hiding it for so long. Check it out, y''all. Everyone who was invited is here. Negative, bossy meat creature! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg ''fixes'' it&hellip; then perhaps gifts! Please, Don-Bot&hellip; look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</p><p>And from now on you''re all named Bender Jr. And why did ''I'' have to take a cab? It''s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Aww, it''s true. I''ve been hiding it for so long. It''s toe-tappingly tragic! Hey! I''m a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Really?!</p><p>I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Leela''s gonna kill me. Why would I want to know that? Hey, whatcha watching?</p><p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg ''fixes'' it&hellip; then perhaps gifts! I''ll get my kit! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Fry! Stay back! He''s too powerful!</p><p>Good news, everyone! There''s a report on TV with some very bad news! That''s not soon enough! No, of course not. It was&hellip; uh&hellip; porno. Yeah, that''s it. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don''t pay you or let you go. Michelle, I don''t regret this, but I both rue and lament it. No! Don''t jump! Kids don''t turn rotten just from watching TV.</p><p>I''m sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Michelle, I don''t regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Bender, quit destroying the universe! I never loved you.</p><h3>Roswell That Ends Well</h3><p>Fatal. Ok, we''ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we''ll go ride the bumper cars. When will that be? I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Aww, it''s true. I''ve been hiding it for so long. Please, Don-Bot&hellip; look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</p><p>They''re like sex, except I''m having them! There''s no part of that sentence I didn''t like! Look, last night was a mistake.</p><p>Dear God, they''ll be killed on our doorstep! And there''s no trash pickup until January 3rd. I''ll get my kit! You mean while I''m sleeping in it? Why would I want to know that? They''re like sex, except I''m having them! Bender, this is Fry''s decision&hellip; and he made it wrong. So it''s time for us to interfere in his life. Then we''ll go with that data file!</p><p>Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Say it in Russian! Well, let''s just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. It''s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. I''m sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Then we''ll go with that data file!</p>'
